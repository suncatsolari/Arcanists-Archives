			<p>Court aasimar appear among the elves of Ebberon, and combine the celestial gifts of the aasimar with the long lifespan and fey blood of the elves.</p>
			<p>They have aasimar traits from <em>Volo's Guide to Monsters</em>, plus the traits below.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> You mature at the same rate of an elf, but you can live up to 1,000 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Trance.</em></strong> You don't need to sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefits that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Extra Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Elvish.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Guidance From the Past.</em></strong> Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to draw from your connection to your ancestors. Misty tendrils flow around you, whispering advice that only you can hear. <br/>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you gain advantage on all Wisdom checks and saving throws. <br/>Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
