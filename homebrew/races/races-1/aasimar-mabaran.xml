			<p>If your aasimar's powers flow from Mabar, you can use the fallen aasimar subrace from <em>Volo's Guide to Monsters</em>, but forgo the Healing Hands and Light Bearer traits, and instead use the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Necrotic Shroud</em></strong> Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you must each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Consuming Touch.</em></strong> As an action, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes necrotic damage equal to your level and you regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt (round up). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this trait.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Herald of Doom.</em></strong> You know the <em>toll the dead</em> cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
