			<p>If your aasimar's powers flow from Mabar, you can use the fallen aasimar subrace from <em>Volo's Guide to Monsters</em>, but forgo the Healing Hands and Light Bearer traits, and instead use the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Consuming Touch.</em></strong> As an action, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes necrotic damage equal to your level and you regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt (round up). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this trait.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Herald of Doom.</em></strong> You know the <em>toll the dead</em> cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.
