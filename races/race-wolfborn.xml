            <p class="flavor"><i>"What is it, Fenrir?" Andraste asked softly. The mighty Wolfborn had his nose in the air, his nostrils flaring. He held a finger out so as to soothe her. "Orcs. And a lot of them." Fenrir drew his sword. "Stay close. It will be alright."</i><p>

            <p>Ancient werewolves, after evolving for hundreds of years, were refined into strong, cultured Wolfborn. These wolf-men are descendants of werewolves long forgotten. The Wolfborn are warriors, scholars, and friends.</p>
            <h4>DECEIVING APPEARANCE<h4>
            <p>Wolfborn are tall and muscular, standing over most humanoids. They range from about 6 feet to over 7 feet tall, weighing from 200 to 300 pounds. The Wolfborn are wolf like in appearance, with a long, bestial face and fur covering there bodies. Wolfborn can have black, gray, or white fur, just as wolves can. Wolfborn's sharp teeth and claws make them seem intimidating, but they are generally kind in nature. They have strangely colored eyes, including orange, blue, purple, and brown.</p>
            <h4>GENTLE GIANTS</h4>
            <p>Wolfborn are intimidating in appearance, but this does not carry over to their personalities. Almost all Wolfborn are kind and friendly, and do their best to form friendship with others. Wolfborn work best with others as a result of their ancient ancestors working in packs. Wolfborn are generally very selfless, putting others' needs first. They always try to help out the group, not just themselves.</p>
            <h4>NATURAL SURVIVORS<h4>
            <p>Wolfborn are natural experts at surviving in the wild. Their instincts are honed to the wild perfectly due to years of adaptation. Wolfborn will almost always help get others safe or fed first in a survival situation.</p>
            <h4>WOLFBORN NAMES</h4>
            <p>Wolfborn receive names from their parents. Wolfborn names are adapted from ancient names, or may be reminiscent of a wolf's sounds. Wolfborn that try to integrate themselves into others' culture may take one of that race's names. Wolfborn have two names; one given and one earned. If a Wolfborn has slain a great beast or done a great deed, it may take a second name relating to that.</p>
